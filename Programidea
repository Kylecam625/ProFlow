App Overview and Features
Thought for 2m 13s
Below is an expanded outline of the app’s features and functions. You can use this breakdown to build your flowchart or wireframe. The structure is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step guidance on each part of the user journey.

1. Welcome Screen
Program Idea Input

Text Box: A single text field where the user enters their project idea (e.g., "I want to build a to-do app" or "I want to build an e-commerce store").
Submit Button: Once the user submits, the app moves on to AI-based suggestions.
AI Stack Suggestions

Backend & Frontend Suggestions: After the user enters their idea, the system generates recommended technologies (e.g., React + Node.js, Vue + Flask, etc.).
Database Suggestions: The AI can also suggest a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) based on the idea.
Stack Selection

Dropdown or Radio Buttons: Allows the user to confirm or change the suggested stack.
Continue Button: Takes the user to the next page once they have chosen a stack.
2. Feature Page
Feature Input List

Text Field / ‘Add Feature’ Button: Users type in each feature they want.
Feature Cards: Each feature appears as a separate card or list item (like a to-do list).
AI-Generated Feature Suggestions

Side Panel: Displays additional features the AI recommends based on the project idea and selected stack (e.g., “User Authentication,” “Profile Management,” “Shopping Cart,” etc.).
Drag-and-Drop: Users can drag these suggested features into their main feature list, or click a button like “Add” to move them over.
Feature Management

Reorder: Users can drag features to rearrange them.
Delete: Remove a feature they decide isn’t necessary.
Rename: Change the feature’s title for clarity.
3. Feature Details Generation
AI-Generated Descriptions & Steps

When a user clicks a feature: A pop-up or side drawer appears showing two sections:
Description: A general explanation of what the feature does.
Steps to Implement: A step-by-step guide tailored to the chosen tech stack (e.g., for a React + Node.js project).
Editable Fields

Description Editing: Users can modify or add details to the AI’s description.
Steps Editing: Users can refine the implementation steps to match their exact approach or preferences.
Save and Close

Confirmation Button: After editing, the user saves the changes, and the pop-up closes.
Data Storage: The updated feature details are stored for later review.
4. Approval and Flow Map Creation
Subtask View

Collapsible List: Shows every feature with its associated tasks/steps underneath.
Final Review: Users can expand each feature to review the subtasks (implementation steps), ensuring everything is correct and no steps are missing.
Approve & Create Flow Map

Single Button: Once the user is satisfied with the features and subtasks, they click “Approve and Create Flow Map.”
AI Flowchart Generation: The system uses the relationship between features and subtasks to create a visual flowchart.
Node Representation: Each feature is a node.
Connections: Related steps or dependencies are shown as edges/lines between nodes.
Flow Map Visualization

Dynamic Flowchart: Generated using a library like Mermaid.js or D3.js.
Interactive Controls: Users can zoom, pan, and possibly reorder nodes if they want a different layout.
Optional Editing: If feasible, allow the user to rename nodes or rearrange the map for clarity.
5. Export Options
PDF Export

Combines: Flow map, feature list, and implementation steps in a readable format.
Download Button: Let users save the file to their device.
Save/Load Project

Local Storage or Database: Depending on your app design, you might allow users to save their project in a database or local storage so they can return and edit later.
Account System (Optional): If you plan on having users log in, you can store multiple projects under their profile.
Share Link (Optional)

Public/Private Links: Let users generate a shareable link to their flow map and feature set.
6. Key Features for Beginners
Clean, Minimal Interface

Easy navigation, large fonts, simple buttons.
Guided Suggestions

The AI makes it easy to discover new features or technologies without overwhelming the user.
Editable AI Outputs

Users stay in control of the final text and steps, reinforcing their understanding.
Immediate Visual Feedback

The flow map helps beginners “see” how each feature connects to the overall program.
7. Technical Considerations
Frontend

React or Vue: Both are popular frameworks with large communities, great for beginners.
Backend

Node.js (Express) or Flask: Lightweight and straightforward for creating a simple API.
AI Integration

OpenAI API or any large language model API for generating:
Tech stack suggestions.
Feature suggestions.
Descriptions and steps.
Flowchart generation (can be text-based output that you parse into a flowchart library).
Flowchart Library

Mermaid.js: Easy to integrate, uses markdown-like syntax.
D3.js: More flexible but has a steeper learning curve.
Data Model

Features: An array of feature objects, each containing an ID, title, AI-generated description, and steps.
Steps: Each step can have an ID, title, and description for easy display and editing.
8. Example User Flow (Summarized)
User enters project idea (e.g., “Online recipe app”).
AI suggests React, Node.js, MongoDB. User confirms or changes.
User adds features (e.g., “User Login,” “Recipe Submission,” “Recipe Search”).
AI suggests additional features (e.g., “User Comments,” “Rating System”), which the user can add.
User clicks on each feature to view/edit AI-generated description and steps.
User reviews final list of features and subtasks in a collapsible view.
User clicks ‘Approve and Create Flow Map’. AI generates a flowchart.
User reviews or tweaks flowchart and then exports the project details.
How to Translate This into a Flowchart
When building your flowchart, consider each of these major sections as nodes (or groups of nodes) in the flow:

Welcome Screen

Node: “Enter Project Idea”
Node: “AI Suggests Stack”
Node: “Select Stack”
Feature Page

Node: “Add Features (To-Do Style)”
Node: “AI-Suggested Features”
Node: “Manage/Arrange Features”
Feature Details

Node: “AI-Generated Description & Steps”
Node: “Edit/Save Details”
Approval & Flow Map

Node: “Review Subtasks”
Node: “Approve & Generate Flow Map”
Flow Map Visualization

Node: “AI Generates Flowchart”
Node: “User Reviews & (Optionally) Adjusts”
Export/Save

Node: “Export PDF / Save / Share”
Putting It All Together
Core Goal: Provide beginners with a simple, guided experience to plan out their project.
AI Assistance: Used in multiple points—initial stack suggestions, feature brainstorming, detailed implementation instructions, and final flowchart creation.
User Control: Ensures the user can override or edit any AI-provided suggestions for learning and flexibility.
Use this outline to structure each screen (or step) in your flowchart. Each bullet point can become a box/node in the flow. Add arrows to connect these nodes in the logical order a user would follow. This will give you a clear blueprint for how data and interactions move through your application.

Good luck with building your flowchart and your app!
